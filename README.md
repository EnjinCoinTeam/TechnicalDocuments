# Migration From Ethereum ERC-20 ENJ & EFI tokens to Enjin Network

ENJ was an ERC-20 token created in 2017 and laid the foundation for the world’s first NFT gaming ecosystem. Holders who still possess ENJ ERC-20 tokens need to **manually swap** these tokens for mainnet ENJ using the migration contract created by the Enjin team. During this process, the ERC-20 tokens will be burned, and holders will receive new native ENJ tokens at a **1:1 ratio**.
 
Old ERC-20 ENJ tokens will eventually become incompatible with dApps and exchanges. We suggest that everyone migrate their old tokens **as soon as possible**. The token migration of ENJ to the Enjin Blockchain isn’t just a technical shift; it’s a new chapter for its holders and allows users to access the latest features. 

There are two versions of the ENJ / EFI token that can be migrated to native Enjin Mainnet:
- Ethereum **ENJ** — Often referred to as ERC-20 ENJ, as it’s an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Ethereum **EFI** — Often referred to as ERC-20 EFI, as it’s an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. 
These tokens were received by holders before the launch of Efinity Mainnet.

****How to Migrate Ethereum ERC-20 ENJ and ERC-20 EFI Tokens to Native Mainnet ENJ Tokens?****

The migration smart contract allows you to migrate your ENJ and EFI tokens safely **without connecting to any external platforms**. It is a designated Ethereum contract created solely for migration purposes and is not controlled by anyone, including Enjin. It is **open-source**, meaning the code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone. 

Briefly, after ERC-20 ENJ or EFI tokens are sent to the migration contract, these tokens **will be burned** and permanently removed from the Ethereum blockchain, while users who perform the migration **will receive new ENJ** native mainnet tokens. 

Using a migration contract requires users to pay the gas fee on the Ethereum Blockchain. This means that every user who wants to perform the migration **needs to have ETH** in their wallet. We recommend choosing the average (normal) gas fee when sending ENJ tokens to the migration contract. 

The migration can be done from any wallet you usually use to access the ENJ tokens. **All wallets support the migration process**.

To perform the migration, send your ENJ or EFI tokens to the migration smart contract address, which is `0x28e469c9A720117ebe1fbBfc84F690ec73729A8B`. The migration smart contract address begins with `0x28` and ends with `9A8B`; it doesn’t matter if the letters are lower or uppercase. 

For the amount, choose to send the **entire balance** of ENJ or EFI tokens. The migration contract will wait for the full balance to arrive before initiating the migration process. This is done to optimize for high Ethereum gas fees, which are partially covered by Enjin Labs. 

After the transaction is confirmed and broadcasted to the blockchain, the migration process will start and your wallet will be credited with new native ENJ tokens. Depending on the network usage, it may take **2–10 minutes** to process the migration. 

Your wallet will **automatically recognize** the new ENJ tokens, which will be credited to your wallet. This is made possible by the wallet linkage functionality in the migration contract, which leverages standard private key cryptography. The new ENJ tokens are securely tied to the same private key and seed phrase that you used for your previous ERC-20 ENJ or EFI tokens, although the public address will look different.

Congratulations, you have successfully performed the migration. Now you can be sure you hold the **latest ENJ tokens**, which are supported on all exchanges.
